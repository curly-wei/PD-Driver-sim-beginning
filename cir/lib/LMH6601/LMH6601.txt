
			LMH6601 SPICE MODEL PERFORMANCE

	MODEL FEATURES INCLUDE OUTPUT CURRENT THRU THE SUPPLY RAILS,
	OUTPUT SWING, GAIN AND PHASE, SLEW RATE, COMMON MODE REJECTION
	WITH FREQUENCY EFFECTS, POWER SUPPLY REJECTION WITH FREQUENCY
	EFFECTS, INPUT VOLTAGE NOISE WITH 1/F, INPUT CURRENT NOISE,
	INPUT CAPACITANCE, INPUT BIAS CURRENT WITH TEMPERATURE EFFECTS,
	INPUT COMMON MODE RANGE, INPUT OFFSET, HIGH CLOAD EFFECTS,
	OUTPUT IMPEDANCE, OUTPUT CURRENT LIMIT, INPUT AND OUTPUT CLAMPS
	TO THE RAIL, AND QUIESCENT CURRENT VS SUPPLY VOLTAGE.

	MODEL TEMP RANGE IS -40 TO +85 DEG C.

	NOTE THAT MODEL IS FUNCTIONAL OVER THIS	RANGE BUT NOT ALL
	PARAMETERS TRACK THOSE OF THE REAL PART.
